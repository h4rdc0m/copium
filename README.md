# Copium Toolchain

Copium is a modern programming language inspired by the [Carbon Language](https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang) specification. This repository contains the toolchain for Copium, built on top of the LLVM infrastructure for robust compilation and optimization.

## Features

- **LLVM-based backend** for efficient code generation and optimization.
- **Carbon-inspired syntax and semantics** for modern C++-successor features.
- Modular and extensible architecture.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the build instructions in the `docs/BUILD.md`.
3. Try compiling your first Copium program!

## Project Structure

- `src/` — Source code for the Copium compiler and tools.
- `tests/` — Test cases and language samples.
- `docs/` — Documentation and specifications.
